# Understanding quotes

You have to use `\"` to have a double quote `"` in your `RUN` command.
This seems odd coming from Linux, but this is how it works on Windows.
Try the following command in your start menu: press Windows key, then paste the following line and execute the command.

```
powershell -Command $a = \"world\" ; $b = \"hello \"\"$a\"\"\" ; Write-Host \"'$b'\" ; Sleep 5
```

You will see a PowerShell terminal with the output `'hello "world"'`.

That's why you have to write it the same way in your `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
RUN powershell -Command $a = \"world\" ; $b = \"hello \"\"$a\"\"\" ; Write-Host \"'$b'\"
```

or with a good practice using the `SHELL` command

```Dockerfile
SHELL ["powershell", "-Command", "$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'; $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue';"]
RUN $a = \"world\" ; $b = \"hello \"\"$a\"\"\" ; Write-Host \"'$b'\"
```

It is still not a PowerShell script, but a `powershell.exe -Command` call where you have to escape quotes.
